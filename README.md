# Dominant-colors
Images are considered as one of the most important medium of conveying
information. Understanding images and extracting the information from
them such that information can be used for other tasks is an important
aspect of Machine Learning.There are enormous applications of the same
such as use of images in navigation of robots, in self driving cars, medical
diagnosis etc. In this project we aim to discover the colors which are
dominant in an image using K-Means clustering algorithm. K-Means
clustering is unsupervised machine learning algorithm that aims to
partition N pixels into Kclusters in which each pixel belongs to the cluster
with the nearest mean. Here K refers to the number of colors we are
trying to extract from the image. We'll use numpy and sklearn libraries for
clustering and image processing via opencv library with python
programming language
